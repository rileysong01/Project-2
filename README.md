## Description

Develop an application that uses Node and Express to create a RESTful API, Handlebars as the template engine, MySQL and Sequelize ORM for the database. The app should have both GET and POST routes for retrieving and adding new data. Must have a folder structure that meets the MVC paradigm that includes authentication (express-session and cookies) and protects API keys and sensitive information with environment variables.

```
node index.js
```
